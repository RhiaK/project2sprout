# project2sprout

Sprout is an app that allows parents to stay informed about their child's wherabouts. I see it as being particularly helpful for busy parents or divorced/seperated parents. It allows the parent with current possesion of the child to easily send a message to their parenting partner that automatically populates the location and name of the child so both parents are always aware of the child's location for both peace of mind and in case of an emergency.

I used HTML/EJS, CSS/Bootstrap, node.js, javascript, mongo, mongoose, and heroku to create this app.

Problems:
I am having trouble with the path of the name of the object being added to the user as a location.
